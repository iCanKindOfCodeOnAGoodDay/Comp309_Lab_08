    Description:      The program.... makes the finding that Python arrays are faster when using math.sin calculations      than Numpy arrays when USING MATH.sin. But NP Arrays can     calculate np.sin in parallel,      making those calculations over 10x faster than math.sin calculations on python arrays.
